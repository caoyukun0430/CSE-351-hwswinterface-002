You will provide your solution to this homework by
editing the collection of functions in this source file.

INTEGER CODING RULES:

  Replace the "return" statement in each function with one
  or more lines of C code that implements the function. Your code
  must conform to the following style:

  int Funct(arg1, arg2, ...) {
      /* brief description of how your implementation works */
      int var1 = Expr1;
      ...
      int varM = ExprM;

      varJ = ExprJ;
      ...
      varN = ExprN;
      return ExprR;
  }

  Each "Expr" is an expression using ONLY the following:
  1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are
     not allowed to use big constants such as 0xffffffff.
     However, you are allowed to combine constants to values greater
     than 255 or less than 0. e.g. 250 + 250 = 500, so long as
     the operator you are using to combine the constants is listed as
     "legal" at the top of the method you are writing.
  2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
  3. Any operators listed as "allowed" at the top of the method you are writing.
  4. casting.

  Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
  Each "Expr" may consist of multiple operators. You are not restricted to
  one operator per line.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
  1. Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch, etc. (unless
     otherwise stated).
  2. Define or use any macros.
  3. Define any additional functions in this file.
  4. Call any functions (unless otherwise stated).
  5. Use any operators not "allowed" at the top of the method you are writing.

  You may assume that your machine:
  1. Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
  2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
  3. Has *undefined* behavior when shifting by a negative amount or an amount
     greater than or equal to the number of bits in the value being shifted.
     e.g. For x >> n, shifts by n < 0 or n >= *size of x* are undefined
     e.g. if x is a 32-bit int, shifts by >= 32 bits are undefined
     Undefined means you do not know what result you will get from the operation.
