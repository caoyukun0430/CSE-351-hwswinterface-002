1
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:06,719
[MUSIC]. 
Well, we've come to the end of the 

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,160
course. 
And we'd really like to thank you all for 

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,430
having made it this far with us. 
this has been an incredible learning 

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,647
experience for us on how to deliver this 
kind of material. 

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:26,120
Over Coursera and over the over the video 
format and Distance Learning. 

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,710
And we hope that you learned a lot about 
the computer systems we've been talking 

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,840
about as well. 
the course might, might not, this course 

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,235
format may not have been as new to some 
of you. 

9
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,280
you might have done other courses like 
this before. 

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,540
we'd be very interested to hear about 
your experience and, and how, what you 

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,110
thought of how we ran this. 
for us, it's brand new, so we have a lot 

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,218
more to learn than you do about that 
aspect. 

13
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:59,210
and 
Well, thank you very much for putting up 

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,970
with us all of the way through. 
 >> And well. 

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,649
We also hope that you, you learned how, 
your programs run in a computer system. 

16
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,927
Have a better idea how, how computers 
work. 

17
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:13,148
And we hope that, this, course has 
spurred your interest in learning more 

18
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:16,498
about programming in C. 
And learning more about, and, and other 

19
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:20,470
programming languages. 
And in learning more about how operating 

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,280
systems work and computer architecture 
and, and so on. 

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,980
We also hope that the, the labs and 
assignments were more rewarding than 

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,090
frustrating. 
We know some of them were quite time 

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,150
intensive, but we really hope that they 
gave you a much better understanding of 

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,440
how things work. 
So in case that you noticed that Gaitan 

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,130
and I wore the same shirt throughout the 
entire course. 

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,000
So and as a gift for you at the end of 
the course, we decided to show you how we 

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,630
normally dress. 
 >> So as you can see we like dressing 

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,590
pretty differently. 
Luis is very formal, loves dressing up. 

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,760
 >> And this is his regalia from the 
University of Illinois. 

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,430
And I'm a little less formal. 
 >> Right as you can see guys, Gaitan 

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,120
really likes football. 
But most importantly you see that his 

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,490
number is 32, which is a power of 2. 
Really to, you know, as homage to his 

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,385
Computer Science devoted life. 
[LAUGH] And I'm sure you saw this number 

34
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:22,640
32 in the course a lot. 
And you're going to continue seeing the 

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,310
number 32, in doing Computer Science. 
 >> Well, so, again we'd like to thank 

36
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,180
you for taking the course with us. 
And we hope it was valuable for you, it 

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,070
certainly was for us. 
And we look forward to maybe seeing you 

38
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,381
again sometime soon. 
so from Seattle, take care, and keep on 

39
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:45,620
programming. 
 >> Thank you very much, keep on 

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,190
programming.
