00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,211
[MUSIC] This video is to help you set up 
a Virtual Machine environment on your own 

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,300
computer. 
so that we can have a common environment 

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:12,120
for every student in the class to use. 
If you go to our course webpage on the 

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:23,726
Coursera website you'll find a. 
In our nav-, left navigation bar the, 

5
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:27,272
the, the heading Virtual Machine 
Installation. 

6
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:31,432
Click on that and you'll get a detailed 
set of instructions on how to install a 

7
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:35,073
Virtual Machine. 
That will give us all a common 

8
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:40,040
programming environment in which to do 
the assignments in the course. 

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,542
The important things to do first are to 
download a Virtual Machine player. 

10
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:50,370
Now, we're going to be doing this for the 
Windows environment so we're going to be 

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,435
loading a free VMware player. 
for those of you running Macs or Linux, 

12
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:59,870
you might want to try out Virtual Box to 
do that. 

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,090
We won't be supporting anything other 
than the Windows environment. 

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,006
But you can find a similar set of 
instructions will work on, for Virtual 

15
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:14,798
Box as well. 
So if we click on the VM Player, we'll go 

16
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:19,714
to the VM Ware website, where you'll find 
a Download button. 

17
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:26,350
to click on and see a whole set of 
possible VMware players to use. 

18
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,552
We're going to choose the Windows 32-bit 
and 64-bit player. 

19
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:35,876
And click on that Download. 
That will let us save an exe file on our 

20
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:39,505
machine. 
[SOUND] After the file is done 

21
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:43,674
downloading, you'll see this icon on your 
desktop. 

22
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:51,192
Just double-click on that and run the 
installer for the VMware. 

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,927
Once that's completed, you'll find the 
following icon on your desktop for the VM 

24
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:15,707
player. 
But before we do anything else, let's go 

25
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:22,752
back to our instructions. 
And, and look at the next thing we need 

26
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:26,506
to do. 
As we go further down, you'll see 

27
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:31,243
download instructions for the actual 
Virtual Machine image we'll be using. 

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,650
That is available here under the Linux VM 
installation and Setup. 

29
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,460
We'll be using a Linux Virtual Machine. 
This is a very large file. 

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,644
It's about 1.3 gigabytes, so we recommend 
that you allocate enough time to get this 

31
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:51,165
downloaded. 
the file is also compressed, so you'll 

32
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:56,558
need the compression utility called 7zip. 
So if you don't have that on your 

33
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:01,058
machine, you'll find a link here to go 
find 7zip and install it. 

34
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:08,878
again, I'm going to install the 64 bit 
Windows version and put that on my 

35
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,878
machine as well. 

36
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,326
[NOISE]. 

37
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:20,862
For those of you who are not on Windows, 
further down on this page you'll find 

38
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:25,984
instructions for Mac OS and Linux 
versions of 7zip. 

39
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:31,617
Okay, the next thing then we'll need is 
the actual Virtual Machine file itself. 

40
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:36,441
you can download that here by fetching 
the Virtual Machine image directly from 

41
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:41,864
the Coursera server. 
Or you can set up a bit torrent to help 

42
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:46,604
you download the file. 
We'll leave that to you to figure out. 

43
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:50,314
All the instructions are here. 
I am just going to download the Virtual 

44
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,773
Machine image directly. 
And you'll notice it's a file called 

45
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,520
VM.7z. 
And place that on my desktop as well. 

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,485
So, after the file has downloaded, and 
that could take a while, you'll find two 

47
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:11,160
more icons on your desktop. 
One is the Virtual Machine. 

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,960
File itself zipped, and the other is the 
7zip installer. 

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,584
So let's get the 7zip utility installed 
first. 

50
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:27,530
just do the basic recommended 
installation. 

51
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,770
That shouldn't take very long. 
And then we can, right-click on the 

52
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,770
Virtual Machine file. 
And ask, 7zip to extract it here. 

53
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:48,373
So what it will now do is extract the 
file into a folder, in this directory. 

54
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,853
Okay, when that's completed, you'll have 
a folder called VM. 

55
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:59,008
And if you double-click on that, you'll 
see a set of files in that. 

56
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,282
let's not worry about that just quite 
yet. 

57
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:07,780
we'll we'll be using the VMware player to 
play one of those files. 

58
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,430
And set up our environment for us. 
So if we click on VMWare, we can open a 

59
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,168
Virtual Machine. 
And what we'll do is naivgate to that 

60
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:21,986
file. 
And you'll notice, there's only one file 

61
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:28,470
that we can actually open. 
called Fedora 64-bit. 

62
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,216
We'll open that. 
And then click Play our Virtual Machine. 

63
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:40,392
Just click I copied it to get things 
started. 

64
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:46,830
And just remind me later or okay to the 
various things that will ask. 

65
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:54,374
And you'll now see it install. 
The actual Virtaul Machine that we'll be 

66
00:05:54,374 --> 00:06:02,262
using. 
OK, once that decompression is completed 

67
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:10,190
we'll have a VM folder. 
That contains our Virtual Machine image. 

68
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,536
We're going to execute, that Virtual 
Machine by using the VM Ware player. 

69
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:27,570
So double-click on the VM Ware icon. 
And open a new Virtual Machine. 

70
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,990
On that folder, navigating to it if 
necessary. 

71
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,836
And then selecting that, Virtual Machine, 
and playing it. 

72
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:45,530
Just click I copied if that pops up. 
And remind me later if, necessary. 

73
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,230
And you'll see it go through a sequence 
of installation. 

74
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:55,660
Operations for that Virtual Machine. 
This may take a few seconds. 

75
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,354
Okay, when it's completed the 
installation, we'll see a window on, 

76
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:25,624
through our Virtual Machine, and a log in 
for our default users, happy user. 

77
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:32,356
If we click on that, we'll see that it 
brings up a screen with a few icons on on 

78
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:39,646
the top of the screen. 
And a few icons in the menu bar up at the 

79
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:43,353
top. 
One of the first things you'll want to do 

80
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:46,880
is click on the Eexclamation point, 
either here or here. 

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,708
And this is a little script that we've 
included that updates all the course 

82
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,328
materials. 
So, what I've just done is updated the 

83
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:59,080
course materials so that I can get 
started on the first homework assignment, 

84
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,792
the first laboratory assignment, Lab 
zero. 

85
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:08,723
Okay. 
The next thing I'll want to do is open up 

86
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:18,570
a terminal window using the icon here in 
the Applications menu, and type Setup-VM. 

87
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:27,012
That will now let me set a new password 
for my Virtual machine. 

88
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:38,930
oops, thats a mistype. 
And then a new password for my user. 

89
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,903
Okay so now setup is complete and I can 
get started using my Virtual Machine. 

90
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,818
There are a few more things left to do at 
this point and we're going to go back to 

91
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:56,760
our instructions. 
And you'll notice that as we've just 

92
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,106
completed part A. 
And I've shown you how to do that the 

93
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,966
next thing to do is to set up part B. 
And I'll leave that up to you to follow 

94
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:09,986
these instructions carefully. 
you'll notice there's a bunch of commands 

95
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:14,230
you'll have to give to the prompt in the 
Terminal window. 

96
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,544
And this will finally set up everything 
so that it's ready for us to use. 

97
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:25,634
the next video will look at how we get 
started on Lab zero.
