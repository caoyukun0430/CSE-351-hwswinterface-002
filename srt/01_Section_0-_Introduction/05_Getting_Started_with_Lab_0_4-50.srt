00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,469
Okay in this video we're going to look at 
how we go about submitting our first 

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,436
programming assignment, lab zero. 
In the previous video we showed you how 

3
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:18,660
to install the virtual machine you'll be 
using, so lets go back to that VM player 

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,410
icon and double click on that. 
to get our VM started up again. 

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,450
And this time you'll see that it'll be 
listed in the set of VMs available. 

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,930
And we can just double-click that and get 
it to start playing. 

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,800
And again, just dismiss those windows 
that pop up. 

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,907
And it'll go through the installation 
process again. 

9
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:50,900
Since we started it from scratch again. 
And we'll get to our 

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,674
When this is completed we'll get to our 
log in screen. 

11
00:00:53,674 --> 00:01:00,743
for our happy user. 
I will. 

12
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,930
Click on the happy user, type in my 
password, that I set up previously and 

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,922
we'll get started in our virtual machine. 
So, to get started on this first 

14
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:19,542
programming assignment, we're going to go 
to the course materials folder. 

15
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:26,030
Since we already updated the virtual 
machine, previously. 

16
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,830
We will see that labs, there's a lab zero 
folder already set up now. 

17
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,275
Every time you do update course, we will 
download a few more files that'll help 

18
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:40,348
you with the next homework assignment. 
So, let's open up lab zero and we'll see 

19
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:46,179
that there's a C file called Arrays.C. 
We can edit that file using the Emacs 

20
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,480
editor, although you can set up to use 
any editor you like. 

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,472
There's many available here under the 
Applications menu or the Accessories 

22
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:59,684
menu. 
So, I'm just going to up to our menu bar 

23
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:03,520
and click Emacs. 
Once Emacs comes up. 

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,000
I can go and open an existing file. 
And navigate to course materials. 

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,526
Lab zero Arrays.C. 
And here we'll see the contents of that 

26
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:17,960
file inside of Emacs. 
And I can. 

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,580
Now edit this file following the 
instructions for the homework assignment. 

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,932
Once I'm done, once I'm done with all of 
the things that I have to do for lab zero 

29
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:31,546
and I've finished my edits to the 
Arrays.C file. 

30
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:36,154
I can save it from Emacs and then go to a 
terminal window by just clicking on the 

31
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:44,450
terminal icon. 
And navigate to the lab zero directory. 

32
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,783
I can do that Linux by using the 
directory listing command, ls. 

33
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:55,332
and then the change directory command. 
In this case, I'm changing the directory 

34
00:02:55,332 --> 00:03:00,004
to course materials. 
then listing its contents and changing 

35
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:04,590
the directory again to lab zero, where we 
see the Arrays.C file. 

36
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,710
At this point I can type submit homework, 
lab zero. 

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,415
Submit homework-homework is a little 
utility we've provided to help you with 

38
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:17,950
the submission process. 
And it asks me for my email address that 

39
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,830
I will need for my submission, if I can 
spell it correctly. 

40
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,310
And then, for my submission password. 
The submission password is not your 

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:37,628
Coursera password, but a single use 
password that's generated on the website. 

42
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:44,362
for your particular username. 
So, if I go to programming assignments, 

43
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:48,374
at the very top here I will see my 
submission log in, my email address I'm 

44
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:54,030
using, and a submission password. 
I can generate new passwords by just 

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,830
clicking on this. 
And then I have to make sure to use the 

46
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,054
most current one. 
so I'm going to use this one right now 

47
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,480
and go type that into the my virtual 
machine. 

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:11,420
I can take that password and type it in 
here. 

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,457
You will not see it being echoed to the 
screen so be careful in typing it in and 

50
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,519
making sure that you have all the . 
. 

51
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,232
. 
capital letters and lower case letters, 

52
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:28,116
correct? 
And then you can confirm that is in fact 

53
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:35,430
the file that you want to upload and, you 
can officially get credit for, this lab. 

54
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,292
We allow you to do up to three 
submissions and then we'll take the 

55
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:42,232
maximum score across the three. 
And that will be the general policy for 

56
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,619
all the homework assignments in the 
course. 

57
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,943
And you'll, be following essentially the 
same procedure for each one.
